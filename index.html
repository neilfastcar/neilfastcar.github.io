    <h1>Cars</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2> 
    <p>Hi my name is Neil. I have a lot of info on cars, on this website, just for you.</p>
    <h3>First, the top 10 fastest cars in the world 2024.</h3>
    <div>
      <h3> The 10th fastest car in the world is, the Rimac Nevera C Two.
        </h3> 
        <p>Here is some information on the car. Super exotic Ferraris, McLarens, and Lamborghinis are all victims of being less powerful and exclusive than the all-electric Rimac Nevera. The Croatian-built Nevera costs millions, makes logic-defying loads of horsepower, and has a production run so limited—just 150 units—the chance of spotting one is as likely as seeing a stripe-less zebra. Using a monocoque chassis that embeds channels of battery cells beneath its floor, its pair of electric motors at each axle generate as much as 1813 horsepower and manage about 205 miles of estimated driving range. Its $2.2-million-dollar starting price is fitting for its uber-rich customers, one of them being F1 Champion Nico Rosberg. While the Nevera exists as a goalpost for automotive engineering might, it makes us quite optimistic for what will inevitably be greater in the future. The Rimac has a top speed of 256 mph and, goes 0-60 mph in 1.74 seconds. The Rimac also holds a Guinness World Record for the fastest speed in reverse. The Rimac's breaking is great. From 70 mph, the Rimac takes 43 meters to come to a full stop. Now here is a photo of a Rimac Nevera C Two.</p>

        <h3>Next up, we have the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport, the 9th fastest car in the world.</h3> <p>The Bugatti has a top speed of 267.856 mph and goes 0-60 in 2.5 seconds. The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuß, with the exterior being designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen. Much of the engineering work was conducted under the guidance of chief technical officer Wolfgang Schreiber. The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester Audiosysteme. Bugatti claims the Veyron will brake from 400 km/h (249 mph) to a standstill in less than 10 seconds, though distance covered in this time will be half a kilometre (third of a mile). You won't get this car now because, all of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 have been sold. </p>

<h3>Now, for the 8th fastest car in the world, the Hennessey Venom GT.</h3>
<p>On January 21, 2013, the Venom GT set a Guinness World Record for the fastest road legal car from 0-186 mph (0-300 km/h) with an average acceleration time of 13.63 seconds.In addition, the car set an unofficial record for 0-200 mph (0-322 km/h) acceleration at 14.51 seconds, beating the Koenigsegg Agera R's time of 17.68 seconds, making it the unofficial fastest accelerating road legal car in the world. The Hennessey Venom GT is succeeded by the Hennessey Venom F5, which was unveiled in November 2017; unlike its predecessor, it is a series production car built completely from the ground up, including chassis and engine. A single unit of the Venom GT Spyder, called the Final Edition, was produced to commemorate the car's six year production run and to mark an end to the production of the Venom GT. The engine output is the same but the curb weight has been decreased by 9 lb (4 kg). The car is painted "Glacier Blue" with double narrow white stripes. The vehicle was pre-sold for US$1.2 million before its public debut.</p>

  <h3>Now, it's time for the 7th fastest car in the world, Koenigsegg Agera RS.</h3>
  <p>The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish car manufacturer, Christian Von Koenigsegg. It is a successor to the CCX/CCXR. The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means "to act" or in imperative form "(You) act!". It was named Hypercar of the Year in 2010 by Top Gear magazine. The Agera RS variant became the world's fastest production car in 2017, setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way average top speed of 447 km/h (278 mph) and a fastest straight-line speed of 458 km/h (285 mph). It can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 2.8 seconds and attain a theoretical top speed of 439 km/h (273 mph). The Agera R has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.37, or Cd=0.33 at high speed due to its adaptive rear wing, while producing 300 kg (660 lb) of downforce at 250 km/h (155 mph). This adaptive rear wing system is lighter than conventional hydraulic/electrical adaptive systems, and has the unique ability to compensate for head/tailwind due to its spring-loaded design. Furthermore, the pylons holding the wing play not only a role in the Agera R's aerodynamic performance, but also assist in extracting hot air from the engine bay.
  The Koenigsegg Agera RS has 1160 braking horsepower.</p>

    <h3>Now it's time for the 6th fastest car in the world, the SSC Tuatara.</h3>
    <p>he SSC Tuatara /'tuətɑːrə/ is a sports car designed, developed and manufactured by American automobile manufacturer SSC North America (formerly Shelby SuperCars Inc.). The car is the successor to the Ultimate Aero and is the result of a design collaboration between Jason Castriota and SSC. Initially powered by a 6.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the capacity of the engine was later reduced to 5.9 L (360.8 cu in) in order to allow the engine to have a higher redline of 8,800 rpm. SSC had stated that the power output would be rated at 1,350 hp (1,000 kW) or 1,750 hp (1,300 kW) on E85 fuel, along with a 300 mph (483 km/h)+ top speed.On October 10, 2020, the Tuatara – according to SSC (pending independent confirmation) – claimed a disputed production car top speed record, recording a one-way top speed of 331.15 mph (532.93 km/h) and a two-way average of 316.11 mph (508.73 km/h) on a seven-mile stretch of temporarily closed Nevada State Route 160 near Pahrump, outside of Las Vegas. SSC claims that this speed beat the Koenigsegg Agera RS's record, which set a record on the same highway in 2017, by 46.6 mph (75.0 km/h). British racing driver Oliver Webb piloted the car. In a video on the SSC North America YouTube channel uploaded October 30, 2020, SSC's founder Jerod Shelby stated that the run had been ruined after they started seeing some doubts, and the only way to fix them was to re-run the top speed in the near future. SSC released a statement on July 21, 2021 stating that the initial record attempt did not reach over 300 mph (483 km/h).

On January 17, 2021, the Tuatara achieved a speed of 279.7 mph (450.1 km/h) during its northbound run and 286.1 mph (460.4 km/h) during its southbound with a two-way average of 282.9 mph (455.3 km/h) over the course of 2.3 miles (3.7 km) at Space Florida's Launch and Landing Facility.[14] American dentist and entrepreneur Larry Caplin, owner of the car, piloted it during the run, which was verified with multiple satellite tracking systems from Racelogic, Life Racing, Garmin, and IMRA.[15]

In April 2021 while traveling back to Florida to reattempt the speed record, the Tuatara was damaged after its trailer flipped over due to high winds in Utah.[16]

On May 14, 2022, Larry Caplin's Tuatara reached a one-way speed of 295 mph (475 km/h) over the course of 2.3 miles (3.7 km) at Space Florida's Launch and Landing Facility. This was verified by two Racelogic VBOX GNSS and a Life Racing GPS speed measurement systems, as well as a Racelogic technician on hand.</p>

  <h3>Now, we are half way through the top 10 fastest cars in the world because, we are up to the 5th fastest car in the world. The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+.</h3>
  <p> The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300 +, is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016. The car's design was initially previewed with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show.

The car is named after the Monégasque driver Louis Chiron.[12] The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car. The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[13] The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.[14][15]

Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system. The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.[19]

The Chiron can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0-200 km/h (0-124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0-300 km/h (0-186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.

The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375-380 km/h (233-236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving. Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed. Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg-imp; 10.45 mpg-US). The first 200 cars were sold before the first was delivered. The base price is €2,400,00 and buyers were required to place a €200,000 deposit before their purchase. The first three Chiron were delivered to their owners in Europe and the Middle East in March 2017 In January 2022, every Chiron had been sold. In September 2023, Bugatti built the last base-spec (non-variant) Chiron; a Nocturne Black and Copper Chiron with a "Copper" tan interior. The Chiron production run ended in May 2024 with the Chiron L'Ultime. A North-American market Super Sport model with fading blue paint and writings of the Chiron's history and achievements all over the car. However, Bugatti still continues to manufacture cars based off the Chiron. Chiron Super Sport 300+ (2019)


Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ at the Salon Privé Concours d'Elegance 2020, Blenheim Palace.
On 8 September 2019, Bugatti presented a limited production high performance variant of the Chiron called the Chiron Super Sport 300+ to owners taking part in the company's 110th-anniversary tour in Europe. The variant is limited to 30 examples at a net unit price of 3.5 million euros. Changes from the standard Chiron include a more powerful engine, increased top speed, and a characteristic paint scheme featuring a lacquer-coated carbon fibre body with orange stripes, echoing the aesthetics of the company's previous top speed record-breaking cars, the Veyron Super Sport World Record Edition and the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse World Record Car.

The car is powered by a 1,600 PS (1,175 kW; 1,580 hp) quad-turbocharged W16 engine shared with the Bugatti Centodieci, nicknamed "Thor". This car has a grey Bugatti logo made of black enamel and silver, the exhaust system from the Centodieci, a modified gearbox with longer ratios and front and rear bumpers optimised for aerodynamics at high speed, resulting in the overall length increase of the car by 248.9 mm (9.8 in).

The Super Sport 300+ was also equipped with a top speed limiter, akin to the one found in the standard Chiron. Without the limiter, Bugatti claims that the car can attain a maximum speed in excess of 483 km/h (300 mph), as was achieved in August 2019 with a pre-production model. Bugatti also prepared the cars of owners who want to take the car to its full potential at the Ehra-Lessien test track.

The first eight were delivered in September 2021.

Bugatti delivered the final Chiron Super Sport 300+ on 21 July 2022.</p>

  <h3>Now, for the 4th fastest car in the world, the Bugatti Bolide.</h3>
  <p> The Bugatti Bolide is a track-only sports car developed by Bugatti Engineering GmbH in Wolfsburg, Germany and Bugatti Automobiles and manufactured in Molsheim, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., revealed online on October 28, 2020. According to Bugatti, the concept version of the Bolide is using the W16 engine with a weight-to-power-ratio of 0.91 kg/kW (0.67 kg/PS; 1.50 lb/hp). Bugatti announced the Bolide would be the last car ever made with their 8.0 liter W16 engine with four turbochargers. The Bolide's name comes from the term le bolide, which literally means "the racing car" in French.

In April 2023, Bugatti revealed the production version of the Bolide as a track-only sports car.[3] 40 units are to be built and the first vehicles were delivered to customers at the beginning of 2024. The technical demonstrator Bolide is built using the framework of the same 8-liter quad-turbo W16 engine and the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission used in the Chiron, although upgrades to the W16 engine allow the Bolide to generate over 1,361 kW (1,825 hp; 1,850 PS) and 1,850 N⋅m (1,364 lb⋅ft) of torque, 183 kW (245 hp; 248 PS), more than the Chiron Super Sport 300+. This increase in power can be attributed to bigger blades in the turbochargers and the different orientation of the turbochargers themselves. Combining the fact that the curb weight of the car is only 1,240 kg (2,733.7 lb), the Bolide can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.2 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 4.4 seconds, 0–299 km/h (186 mph) in 7.4 seconds, 0–401 km/h (249 mph) in 12.1 seconds, and 0–501 km/h (311 mph) in 20.1 seconds and a top speed projected of more than 501 km/h (311 mph). Additionally, Bugatti states that the Bolide has a 0–401–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) of 24.62 seconds, and a 0–501–0 km/h (0–311–0 mph) time of 33.62 seconds. According to Bugatti, computer simulations show that the Bolide could lap the Nürburgring in 5 minutes and 23.1 seconds, making it just four seconds slower than the current record holder, the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo. The Bolide is also simulated to have a lap time at the Circuit de la Sarthe of just 3 minutes and 7.1 seconds, making it 7.6 seconds quicker than the current record holder, the Toyota TS050, which lapped the circuit in 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds.

The series version of the Bugatti Bolide continues to rely on the 8.0-liter W16 engine with four turbochargers with an output of 1600 PS at 7050 rpm and a torque of 1600 Nm between 3800 and 7050 rpm. This enables the standard version of the Bolide to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.2 seconds, to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 5.4 seconds and to 300 km/h (186 mph) in 11.5 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited at 380 km/h (236 mph). 

From 300 km/h, the Bolide series version brakes in 6 seconds and stops after 228 m (748 ft). From 200 km/h, the Bolide needs 4.2 seconds and 105 m (344 ft). From 100 km/h, the Bolide needs 2.5 seconds and 30 m (98 ft) to come to a standstill. For acceleration and full braking from 0-100-0 km/h, the Bolide needs 4.7 seconds and 74 m (243 ft). At 0-200-0 km/h it takes 9.7 seconds and 285 m (935 ft), and at 0-300-0 km/h it takes 17.5 seconds and 832 m (2,730 ft). The main influence on the Bolide's light curb weight is due to the monocoque and all of its components constructed with titanium, along with nearly all of the body panels constructed in carbon fiber. Donning the aggressive design language of an LMP1 racecar (specifically the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept, which preceded the Bolide), including the signature X-shape (itself inspired by the Bell X-1 aircraft), the aerodynamics of the Bolide help it generate more than 2,630 kg (5,800 lb) of downforce at 320 km/h (200 mph), with 1,810 kg (4,000 lb) at the rear wing and another 820 kg (1,800 lb) at the front wing. The height of the Bolide, 100 cm (39.2 in), matches the height of the famous Bugatti Le Mans racecar, the Bugatti Type 57C, on which much of the Bolide harkens to. In August 2021, Bugatti announced at The Quail, A Motorsport Gathering in California that the production Bolide has its first delivery scheduled for 2024 at a net unit price of €4 million and limited to 40 units. Although the concept version boasted a power output of 1,361 kW (1,825 hp; 1,850 PS), this was achieved using 110-octane racing fuel. The production version will have a power output of 1,177 kW (1,578 hp; 1,600 PS) with a torque figure of 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lbf⋅ft) at 2,250 rpm using 98 RON gas. The production version will weigh in at 1,450 kg (3,197 lb) and therefore will have a weight-to-power ratio of 1.2 kg/kW (0.9 kg/PS; 2.0 lb/hp) when 98 RON gas is used by The first production-ready cars have been delivered to customers since the beginning of 2024.</p>

  <h3>Now we've got into the top 3 fastest cars in the world. The 3rd fastest car is the Hennessey Venom F5.</h3>
  <p> The Hennessey Venom F5 is a sports car developed and manufactured by the American vehicle-manufacturing company Hennessey Special Vehicles which was established in 2017. Hennessey has contracted with Delta Motorsport of Silverstone, England for the development of the vehicle, which will be the company's first all new proprietary vehicle as an accredited titled manufacturer. Delta Motorsport also produced all of the previous generation Venom GT cars for Hennessey at its facility in England.

The F5 name is a reference to the F5 tornado, the highest rating on the Fujita scale, attaining wind speeds as high as 261–318 mph (420–512 km/h).Hennessey as a manufacturer aims to reach top speeds in excess of 311 mph (500 km/h) to attain the title of world‘s fastest production car. The available transmission is a CIMA[15] 7-speed single-clutch automated manual transmission with paddle-shifters, driving the rear wheels, making the car rear-wheel drive.[16]

The chassis and body will be made almost entirely of carbon fiber. Active aerodynamics are now paired with the body, a first for Hennessey. The weight reportedly stands at 2,950 lb (1,338 kg) with fluids, setting the power-to-weight ratio at 1,358 hp per ton.[17] Because of the use of active aerodynamics and a sleek, new design it has an estimated drag coefficient of Cd=0.33.[18] For the production F5, this was increased to a claimed Cd=0.39.[19]

Hennessey has also placed great emphasis on interior space, quality and comfort, and that despite offering extreme performance the vehicle still will offer a spacious and comfortable interior experience that can accommodate tall and large drivers and passengers. It was mentioned that an undisclosed NFL player, who has only been described as being 6'7" tall, has placed an order for one of the first models once full production has commenced.[20]

Each Venom F5 comes with the "Treasure Chest", a giant aluminum box containing the key fob, a magnetic trickle charger, and a tow hook. The key fob's serial number plate is made from a metal component that was disposed from a Space Shuttle launch. Company founder John Hennessey was given the component by an astronaut and broke it into pieces to give Venom F5 owners "a piece of space". Production will be limited to 24 units, 12 of which were already sold by December 2020. The price of the car in the United States was initially US$1.6 million, but later increased to US$2.1 million for the remaining 12 units.[4] Eight cars are planned to be built and delivered in 2021. In August 2021 the company officially announced that it had customer orders for and sold all planned 24 units of the F5.</p>

  <h3>Now we are up to the 2nd fastest car in the world, the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut.</h3>
  <p> The Koenigsegg Jesko is a limited production mid-engine sports car produced by the Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg. The car was introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show and was completely sold out before the show ended. Succeeding the Agera, the Jesko is named as a tribute to the company founder's father, Jesko von Koenigsegg. There are two variations of the car, the "Absolut" and the "Attack". The engine is a development of the 5.1 L (5,065 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the Agera. It has four valves per cylinder each with a bore and stroke of 92 mm × 95.25 mm (3.62 by 3.75 inches) and a compression ratio of 8.6:1. The engine has a power output of 1,280 hp (1,298 PS; 954 kW) at 7,800 rpm and 1,000 N⋅m (738 lb⋅ft) of torque at 2,700 to 6,170 rpm on normal petrol and has a power output of 1,600 hp (1,622 PS; 1,193 kW) and 1,500 N⋅m (1,106 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,100 rpm on E85 biofuel.

Changes from the Agera's engine include the use of a new 180-degree flat-plane crankshaft that saves 5 kg (11 lb) and increases the redline from 8,250 rpm to 8,500 rpm. The Jesko also utilises active rubber mounts from the Regera that reduce engine vibrations in the cabin. The two large turbochargers are equipped with a 20-litre air tank made from carbon fibre, coupled with an electric compressor which feeds pressurised air to the turbochargers at a pressure of 20 bar (290 psi) in order to reduce turbo lag. The engine has pressure sensors for each cylinder in order to achieve real time cylinder monitoring for the multipoint fuel injection system. The engine is mated to an in-house developed 9-speed multi-clutch transmission called the "Light Speed Transmission (LST)" by the manufacturer. The new transmission has a weight of 90 kg (198 lb) and it is at least 50% shorter in length than the previous 7-speed dual-clutch unit. It has 9 forward gear combinations using a layout with an input shaft with 3 fixed gears which is mated to a secondary shaft with 3 gears fixed to the output shaft and 3 clutched gears mated to the input shaft and an output shaft with 4 clutched gears (one set is used for reverse which mates directly to the input shaft), allowing the transmission to change gears without an interruption in power delivery due to the speedy nature of clutch actuation and overlap between the clutches opening and closing. The engine's crankshaft is mated directly to the LST and uses the rotating mass of the transmission components in place of a traditional flywheel. The transmission has a shift time ranging from 20 to 30 milliseconds. It also has an overdrive mode called "Ultimate Power on Demand" that is designed to skip directly to the optimal gear depending on user input, rather than down or upshifting sequentially to that gear.

The transmission is controlled by an onboard computer which uses engine and road speed data to engage a gear. Gears are selected by the driver either using the shift paddles mounted on the steering column or the gear selector. On 26 June 2024, the Jesko Absolut broke the 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) acceleration record with a time of 27.83 seconds. The record was set at an airfield in Örebro, Sweden by factory test driver Markus Lundh.</p>

  <h3>Now its the time we've all been waiting for, the fastest car in the world, the Devel Sixteen.</h3>
  <p> The 5007 HP Devel Sixteen production version launched at Dubai International Motor Show 2017 to pioneer a new era that never has been achieved before. The all-new production model of Devel 16 has a super lightweight, high-strength Carbon fiber body. Extensive research and development into the aerodynamics of the car have lead Devel Motors to push the boundaries of the industry, achieving unprecedented and unparalleled power in a production hyper car. The 81 mm Quad Turbo 12.3 Litre V16 engine generates massive power- 5007 Horsepower and 3757 lb-ft of torque. Devel Sixteen is born with extreme performance and unimaginable outstanding power of ten super cars, to pioneer a new era that never have been achieved before. A distinctive design of this new generation brings you the ultimate breakthrough feeling of a jet fighter with a power surpassing any car in the world. The Devel Sixteen is a mid-engine sports car designed in the United Arab Emirates by Devel Motors. Devel Motors claims the V16 quadruple turbo version of the car to be the fastest car in the world, with a claimed top speed of 348 mph (560 km/h) and a claimed 0–60 mph time of 1.8 seconds; its announced base version price is $1.7 million.[3]

According to Devel Motors, three models of the Sixteen are planned: a base model with a V8 engine producing around 1,500–2,000 hp (1,100–1,500 kW; 1,500–2,000 PS);[4][5] a version with a V16 engine producing around 3,006 hp (2,242 kW; 3,048 PS) and 2,407 lb⋅ft (3,263 N⋅m) of torque;[2] and a track-only version with a quad-turbo V16 engine producing 5,007 hp (3,734 kW; 5,076 PS)[4][5] and 3,757 lb⋅ft (5,094 N⋅m) of torque.[4]
